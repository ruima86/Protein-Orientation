Our solutions can be acquired as follow: First, the ‘MainCode1.m’ file is used to generate the initial solutions with respect to the increasing C_p under different ? that is fixed during calculations, before all solutions and parameters are saved in a data file (‘.mat’ format) which, for example, contributes to Fig. 2(a, c). Then the ‘MainCode2.m’ and ‘MainCode3.m’ files load this data file and increase or decrease ? based on a fixed C_p. If a Gibbs-triangle is encountered, we only choose the solutions with lower energy in the following procedures. The shape equations and boundary conditions have been set in the files ‘shape.m’ and ‘twobc.m’. And the ‘simps.m’ file is used to perform the numerical integrals. All the codes above are packaged into a file for reference.
